# Configurable-Logic-Block-for-FPGA
Configurable logic block (CLB) is the fundamental unit FPGA. A CLB consisting of SRAM, D-flip flop, Multiplexer was made which can perform a particular assigned Boolean function. The functionality was tested in EDA playground using Verilog HDL. Also, a testbench code was developed to test the overall logic block with various testing values.
